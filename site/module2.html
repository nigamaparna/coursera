		<p>
			Mumbai (formerly known as Bombay), India, is famous for its chaotic streets.
 For bargains and people-watching, outdoor bazaars top the list of attractions.
 Popular waterfront destinations are Marine Drive, where visitors go to watch the sun set over the Arabian Sea, and the carnival-like Juhu Beach.
 More sightseeing options are the Gandhi Museum, in the leader's former home, and the cave temples of Elephanta Island.
 For tranquillity, Mumbai has many religious sites, lakes and parks.

			The history of food in Mumbai is closely linked to the growth of this city from fishing village to megapolis. As wave after wave of immigrants from all over the country came with dreams of gold in their eyes, they brought their culinary treasures with them. The result? A smorgasbord of cooking styles and street food that reflects our cosmopolitanism as much as our carbohydrate-fueled work ethic. Here's a sampling of 40 must-try foods that define Mumbai's food culture, with Muslim, Gujarati, Goan, Coastal, South Indian, Parsi and of course local Maharashtrian influences.
